// When the product category is clicked the user is re-directed to that product category page
// The product category page will then display a list of product items that are related to that category
// Products therefore must have a category element within the DB/API
// The route path should be passed up to app.js to change the state to determine which product category has been selected
// i.e. onClick from the li within the category navBar the category.name is passed up to app.js
// app will then need to fetch those category products from the API and pass them to product list to be displayed
